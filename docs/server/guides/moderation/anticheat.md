This list consists of paid anti-cheats to avoid at all costs.

- [AAC (Advanced Anti Cheat)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6442/)
  Version: 1.8 - 1.16  
  Reason: False flags constantly, and has had several exploits. Also has alot of bypasses.

  Price: £14.99
  Currently Active
  
- [Verus](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/335067/)  
  Version: 1.7 - 1.17.1  
  Reason: Has had several disablers that bypassed for months, and even for years, has extremely bad checks, and it takes weeks if not months to get support. Overall garbage, and a waste of money. 
  Price: $60/$125/$200  
  Currently Active

- [Vulcan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/83626/)  
  Version: 1.7 - 1.17  
  Reason: Has several bypasses such as flys and speeds, and the scaffold checks aren't that good either. However, the Owner (frap) is nice and will give fast support. Not a waste of money if you know what your doing.
  Price: $20.00  
  Currently Active
  
- [Spartan Anti Cheat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/25638/)  
  Version: 1.7 - 1.17

- [Taka AntiCheat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/45167/)  
  Version: 1.8 - 1.16

  Price: €8.00  
  Currently Active
  
- [Reflex Machine Learning Cheat Detection](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/21122/)  
  Version: 1.8 - 1.17

  Price: €10.00  
  Currently Active

- [Matrix Anti Cheat](https://matrix.rip)  
  Version: Unknown  
  Reason: It falses alot, has several speeds and even a longjump. Just an scam and waste of money for your server.
